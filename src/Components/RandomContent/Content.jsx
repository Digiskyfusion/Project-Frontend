                    <p className='mt-4 livvic-medium'>Is Television advertising price really sky-rocketing as perceived by most first-time advertisers?  Not really, in fact the TV advertisement price is actually one of the lowest if one considers cost per reach.The reason why TV advertisement price seems to be very high is that running TV ads on one spot means broadcasting your ad to millions of people at a time.
                    If one reach costs me a single rupee too then also running ads on one spot would cost the brand millions.However, on the other side, let’s look at the benefits a brand can get by paying the high television advertising price- reach in millions in a short span of time. 
                    TV advertisements are the best when a brand is looking for mass reach in a very short time.This is one of the reasons why one can find e-commerce brands advertising aggressively on television days or weeks before sale.
